## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(dplyr)


#Importing the Oympic data set to R
Oly <- read.csv('C:/Users/91909/Documents/BA With R Class Notes/R Project/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/athlete_events.csv')

#Creating a column "ttt" which is a uniue combination of Players name and event. 
NewOly <- Oly %>% mutate(ttt=paste(Oly$Name,Oly$Event))
NewOly2 <- NewOly %>% group_by(ttt)

#Removing players with only 2 Olympic appearances and keeping the rest of the data.
NewOly3 <- NewOly2 %>% filter(n()>2)
NewOly3 <- NewOly3 %>% mutate( Medal=as.character(Medal))

#User defined function to categorize medals as 1 and non-medals(NA) as 0
NewX<-function(x){
  num = 0;
  if (!is.na(x == "Bronze" | x == "Gold" | x == "Silver"))
  { 
    return(num = num + 1);
  }
  else return(num)
} 

#Creating a new column where if player has won a medal then 1 else 0
NewOly4 <- NewOly3 %>% mutate(NX=sapply(Medal,NewX))

#The 1st two performances of veterans are not relevant to our analysis.
#so to remove that from the dataset,we are indexing each player's appearances and removing their first two appearances.

#To build Index
new.df <- NewOly4 %>% 
   group_by(ttt) %>% 
   mutate(Index=1:n())

#Removing the first two appearances based on index value. 
new.df1 <- filter(new.df,Index >= 3)

#Trimming the data by considering only columns that are required.
new.df2<-new.df1[c(1,2,3,8,9,13,14,15,17,18)]

#performing logistic regression
logistic <- glm(NX~Event,data = new.df2,family = "binomial")
View(logistic)
summary(logistic)

#Viewing the final model of Events vs medals which are highly significant 
Logsum<-data.frame(summary(logistic)$coef[summary(logistic)$coef[,4] <= .05, 4])
View(Logsum)

#So from the logistic regression model, we have a total of 99 Events where veterans have a significantlyu higher chance of winning when compared to new comers/ amateurs.


 ```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
