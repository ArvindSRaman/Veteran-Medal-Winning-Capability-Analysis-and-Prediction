# Veteran-Medal-Winning-Capability-Analysis-and-Prediction
This is a data science project where I have analyzed the medal winning capability of veterans in over 120 years of International Olympics. A veteran is any athlete who has appeared in the same event for more than 3 times(i.e over 12 years). Since age is also a factor in the selection of international players in the olympics, it was interesting to analyze the veterans performances. Another interesting work that I have done here is, predicting the current veterans performances in the year 2020.
